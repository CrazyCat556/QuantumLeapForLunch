# QuantumSimulation

A simulation of quantum computing operations for educational and entertainment purposes.

## Overview

This project simulates quantum operations in a whimsical manner, providing insights into quantum mechanics while keeping things light-hearted. It includes:

- **Quantum Operations**: Simulates basic quantum gates like Hadamard, CNOT, and measurements.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphical representations of quantum states, which are actually random but look convincing.

## Installation
